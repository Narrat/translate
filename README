`translate` is a command line interface for the Google Translator service
written in Python programming language.

Usage: translate FROM TO [WORDS...]

If WORDS are not given, reads from stdin. This allows piping. Empty stdin enters a text in mode. Enter words and invoke on a newline ^D to leave the text mode and continue translation.
